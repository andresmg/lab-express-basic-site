              <h3>The Rolling Stones</h3>
              <p>
                Leibovitz photographed the Rolling Stones in San Francisco in
                1971 and 1972, and served as the concert-tour photographer for
                the Rolling Stones’ Tour of the Americas ’75. Her favorite photo
                from the tour was a photo of Mick Jagger in an elevator.

              <h3>John Lennon</h3>
              <p>
                On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a photo shoot with John
                Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the
                cover. She had initially tried to get a picture with just Lennon
                alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he
                and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create
                something like the kissing scene from the couple’s Double
                Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had
                John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor.
                Leibovitz recalls,
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                “What is interesting is she said she’d take her top off and I
                said, ‘Leave everything on’‍ — ‌not really preconceiving the
                picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very,
                very strong. You couldn’t help but feel that he was cold and he
                looked like he was clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to
                look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John
                said, ‘You’ve captured our relationship exactly. Promise me
                it’ll be on the cover.’ I looked him in the eye and we shook on
                it.”
              </blockquote>

              <h3>Vanity Fair</h3>
              <p>
                In 1983, Leibovitz left Rolling Stone and began working for
                Vanity Fair. With a wider array of subjects, Leibovitz’s
                photographs for the magazine ranged from presidents to literary
                icons to teen heartthrobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                To date, a number of Vanity Fair covers have featured
                Leibovitz’s stunning — and often controversial — portraits of
                celebrities. Demi Moore (very pregnant and very nude followed by
                a body painting shoot), Whoopi Goldberg (half-submerged in a
                bathtub of milk), Sylvester Stallone (appearing nude in a pose
                inspired by Rodin’s “The Thinker”) and Caitlyn Jenner (in a
                corset after having publicly revealed her identity as a woman)
                are among the most remembered celebs to grace the cover.
