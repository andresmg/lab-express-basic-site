              <h3>Early life</h3>
              <p>
                Born in Waterbury, Connecticut, on October 2, 1949, Anna-Lou
                Leibovitz is the third of six children of Marilyn Edith (n√©e
                Heit) and Samuel Leibovitz. She is a third-generation American.
                Her father was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force of
                Romanian Jewish heritage[4] and her mother was a modern dance
                instructor of Estonian-Jewish heritage. The family moved
                frequently with her father's duty assignments, and she took her
                first pictures when he was stationed in the Philippines during
                the Vietnam War.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leibovitz's passion for art was born out of her mother's
                engagement with dance, music, and painting. While attending
                Northwood High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, she became
                interested in various artistic endeavors and began to write and
                play music.

              <h3>Education</h3>
              <p>
                Leibovitz attended the San Francisco Art Institute, where she
                studied painting with the intention of becoming an art teacher.
                At school, she had her first photography workshop and changed
                her major to photography. She was inspired by the work of Robert
                Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson.
              </p>
              <p>
                For several years, she continued to develop her photography
                skills while holding various jobs, including a stint on a
                kibbutz in Amir, Israel, for several months in 1969.
